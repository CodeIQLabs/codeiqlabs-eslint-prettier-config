## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f2a0ab: Commit package-lock.json for improved dependency consistency
  - Adopt modern best practice of committing package-lock.json for both applications and libraries
  - Ensures consistent dependency resolution across all environments and contributors
  - Improves reproducible builds and reduces dependency-related issues
  - The advice to exclude lockfiles for libraries is outdated - modern practice is to commit
    lockfiles for all project types
  - Package-lock.json is already tracked and will continue to be committed going forward

  This change aligns with current npm and Node.js ecosystem best practices for dependency
  management.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0cda42c: Exclude compiled JavaScript files and improve CI/CD compatibility
  - Add `**/*.js` to ignores to exclude compiled JavaScript files (especially CDK-generated)
  - Remove `.js` from file patterns in base config and lint-staged configs to prevent linting
    compiled files
  - Update React dependencies: `eslint-plugin-react@7.37.0`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@5.0.0`
  - Add `@eslint/js` dependency for enhanced ESLint support
  - Change Husky setup from `prepare` to `postinstall` script for better CI/CD compatibility
  - Add `npm run format` to build script for consistent formatting
  - Clean up eslint.config.mjs by removing unnecessary comments

  This release improves compatibility with CDK projects and other tools that generate JavaScript
  files by excluding them from linting while maintaining strict linting for source TypeScript files.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0bf27f5: feat: restructure package with modular configuration architecture
  - **BREAKING**: Restructured internal configuration architecture for better separation of concerns
  - Added new `src/configs/` directory with modular configuration files:
    - `base.ts` - Fundamental JavaScript/ES2024 rules and globals
    - `typescript.ts` - TypeScript-specific parsing and linting rules
    - `prettier.ts` - Prettier integration configuration
    - `react.ts` - React-specific configurations (separate from minimal)
  - Added new `standard` configuration export for API/backend projects with testing utilities
  - Updated React plugin versions to support ESLint 9.x:
    - `eslint-plugin-react`: ^7.37.0 (was ^7.34.0)
    - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`: ^5.0.0 (was ^4.6.0)
  - Added `@eslint/js` dependency for recommended JavaScript rules
  - Improved error messages for missing React dependencies with installation instructions
  - Enhanced TypeScript configuration with additional recommended rules
  - Better separation ensures minimal config has zero React dependencies

  **Migration Guide:**
  - No breaking changes for consumers - all existing exports work the same
  - New `standard` configuration available for projects needing more comprehensive rules
  - React configurations now properly isolated and only load when explicitly imported

  This resolves dependency conflicts where React plugins were being pulled into non-React projects.
